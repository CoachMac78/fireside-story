    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>A small boat was sailing across the sea to a mysterious island.</p>
  <p>While traversing the waters,a great storm began to rock the ship uncontrollably.</p>
  <p>One of the passengers was thrown overboard into the murky deep.</p>
  <p>Everyone on board languished at the loss but did not want to risk falling in as well. 
  The remaining passengers huddled together to weather the storm. Longing to make it safely 
  to the island of lost treasure.</p>
